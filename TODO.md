# TODO

## Major:

- Redo the routing. ericsclafani.dev/normal does not get routed to correctly.
- Add default page to Projects if github api requests are unsuccessfull.

## Normal mode

- Maybe add more interactions (animations on hover, click, etc...)

## Nerd mode
- Maybe add user options to customize theme, colors, etc...
- Add Up and Down arrow terminal functionality 
- Use github API to retrieve project data and display (just like in normal mode)

## Both modes
